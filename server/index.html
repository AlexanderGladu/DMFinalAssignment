    <p>I honestly do not know what you want for the look of the server, as I do not know exactly what it does. I also do not know how it works, partially due to a lack of paying attention in class when you did some of the things with the server, but also because we never really learned how all of this works, and without knowing how it works, and without any real leads on how you did some of the stuff I was not able to really figure out any of the features of the server.</p>
