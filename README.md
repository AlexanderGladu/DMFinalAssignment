DMFinalAssignment
=================

I took the FinalProject that you wrote and added some functions to the client
that are basically ones that were already written, but do the opposite 
(i.e. took upload and changed it to remove, which removes the file from the list). 
I also customized the look of the client to better suit my tastes. It is darker, 
and easier to look at in dim light. I didn't know how to do the server stuff, so I just changed
the view of the server when it is opened in the web browser.
